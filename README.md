The data collected using the Ultrasonic sensor in a Garage is first analysed and plotted to observe the graphs.

Then, the noise is removed and required echo data points of 512 is extracted from the captured data set.

For the further processing, Machine Learning algrithms have been used to measure the accuracy from the testing data set.
